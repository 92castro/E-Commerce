# E-Commerce-Database

## Description

My task was to finish building the routes of a back-end database for a e-commerce company. I completed constructing the server by linking the routes with the database. This allows a user to request all products based on categories, tags and their IDs when accessing the server. As well as routes for updating the product's price or deleting the product if its been purchased. This database allows the user to manage all products in their inventory based on ID or the category the user assigns them to.

## User Story

I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
